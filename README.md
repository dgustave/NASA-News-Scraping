# Web-Scraping-Challenge
## Before You Begin


## Step 1 - Scraping

Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Selenium:

* Web Scraping (also termed Screen Scraping, Web Data Extraction, Web Harvesting etc.) is a technique employed to extract large amounts of data from websites whereby the data is extracted and saved to a local file in your computer or to a database in table (spreadsheet) format.

* Use the data you obtained, store it in a Mongo Database, and use those items to append to your own website. In this case, its all about Mars.
